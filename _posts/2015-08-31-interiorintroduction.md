Having spent 22 years in the construction industry, I have participated on a variety of projects, from a new build chemical processing plant, Office refurbishments, Factory Fit outs, and major refurbishment works in a live research centre.  

My role started as a ceiling and partition installer in 1993 working as a sub contractor in British Airways maintenance hanger at Heathrow Airport. In 1997 age 22 I was asked to work on a new build chemical plant in Ireland, Within 6 months I was foreman, of a team of 40 operatives.  

On my return to the UK, I was offered a Role as a Senior Fitter, for an interiors fit out company. Where my Roles included on site supervision, Quality Control, Documentation, Organizing Materials, Health and safety, Setting out of larger projects, Hiring of additional labour, and Waste Management.  

I have remained in similar roles to current, but am actively looking for a new challenge.
