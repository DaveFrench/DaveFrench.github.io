I had recently spent some  time developing 3D games using Unity3D and C# and was looking for a new challenge. I was looking to learn a new language as I had been using C# since 2003, I had also just changed phones. I made the decision to learn how to write mobile apps for the Android platform. Now I had to decide what to develop, I had written a Sudoku generating library in C# for an earlier project, and decided porting this to Java would be a good learning experience. I also wanted to write unit tests, to check my port was successful. Choosing to use eclipse as my IDE, unit testing the pure Java code was easy.

Next up was the UI This was simpler than first expected. There is excellent documentation on developer.android.com with the use of XML and dynamic layouts,  handling varying size screens is taken care of. There is room for improvement in my UI, and the use of 81 separate widgets for the grid is questionable, but the basics of the app were formed.  
I decided that the avenue of mobile advertise should be investigated. With a multitude of advertising agencies all pushing mobile adverts, I was not sure where to start. Googling how too “mobile advert tutorial” let to many results leading to the use of the google AdMob service. This was simple to set up, just add the widget to the XML, set the identifier, and add some code to the activity to refresh the adverts.  
There was some tidying up and bug fixes to take care of, but for the first app developed in a language new to me, on a platform also unfamiliar, the process went without any major hitches.  
  
Sudoku Maker Free is currently being used for ~20,000 minuets per week.
