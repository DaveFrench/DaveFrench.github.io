Having worked in the construction industry, I have been used to the complications due to uncoordinated documentation, Many a time, I have seen drawings showing services running over window openings, and AC outlets on top of partition walls.

When a Senior Structural Revit Technician friend of mine showed me Revit, and the concept of creating a single data model, where all documentation can be generated from a single source, I was impressed. No longer was CAD about producing documentation with the use of lines, it had moved onto producing a 3D digital representation that can be used from concept to recycling.

I was given the offer by the above mentioned friend, of training, and I accepted. During this time I have  produced various projects under guidance, including an residential RC buildng, and Steel framed structures.

I sat and passed The AutoDesk Revit 2015 Structural Professional Certification, and am currently seeking employment in this field.
