Having always had a keen interest in Dance Music, both production and DJ'ing, and being surrounded my friends with similar interests, and again looking for a new challenge, I decided to turn my hand to organising and promoting a club night. I spoke about the idea with a few close friends, and this was met with great enthusiasm. Soon there formed a core of 6 team members, between us we had zero experience of club promotion, but experience of many of the tasks that needed to be undertaken from our day jobs in other industry’s.

Two months later we launched our first night in Southend on Sea, in a small venue. All our core members moved in different social circles, and being our launch night it was any easy task to fill the venue, and got some amazing feedback. The club owner was so impressed with the bar takings, that I managed to negotiate the venue for free for future promotions,  I promptly made a monthly booking,  Polymorpic as a club even was born. 

We stayed at this venue for the next 3 months, using this time to expand our skills, and network with other promoters. In this short time we has also built up the start of our loyal fan base, who stayed with us for the four year duration. Unfortunately the venue was sold, and redeveloped into residential accommodation. We was given the news of the closure two weeks before our next planned event.

Having lost our current venue, the search was on for another suitable venue, ideally in close proximity to the previous enabling us to keep our local following. In the week that followed I had many meetings with local club owners, and managed to secure us a booking for the same date as previously planned. With one week remaining until the booked date, we managed to update both our printed and radio advertisements, reorganise club security, sound system, lighting and décor. The decision was made to provide curtsey transport from our previous venue, for any of our fan base that we were unable to reach with out new greatly shorted advertising campaign. The night was a success, again impressing the club owner, who immediately gave us a monthly booking, and due to record bar takings agreed to wave future booking fees.

Polymorphic stayed at this venue for the next year, gaining in popularity, even getting a regular radio show on a local station, guesting our DJ's at many legendary club nights in London, and co hosting a room in the 5000 capacity Stratford Rex.  This lead to accelerating our popularity, and the need for a larger venue.

A very successful promoter approached us, with a proposal for a joint venture in a larger venue. This offer was accepted and lead to a further 18 month venture, with new learning experiences and networking opportunities. One of the opportunities that arose was to organise our own stage for a 3 day event with the legendary band “Hawk Wind”.
