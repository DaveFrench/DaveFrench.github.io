Valmeron Invasion's main objective was to be a project worked on by three friends as an excuse to meet up. This however rapidly dropped to just two members, losing our best story writer had an impact, but we decided to proceed. I had recently been experimenting with Blender for both 3d modelling, and as a game engine. I had also written a small test game in the Unity 3d game engine. The other member of the team, had experience with Revit for 3d modelling.  It was decided to model  in Revit, and use Unity 3d with c#.  We had a story, a rough idea of what we wanted, 6 months of Sundays, no idea how ill prepared we were, and a mission, to publicly release a 3d game.  

The game was to be a first person target hunting game, so there was no need to model a main character. There was some time spent, but the process of importing Revit models of buildings was rather painless. Our first prototype, being able to run around our own 3d world proved to be successful.
